Project Goal: This project is a React/TypeScript application, SPA, focused on displaying my girlfriend's UX design skills and serves as her portfolio. 

Architecture/Framework: The frontend uses React with TypeScript, and is hosted by Github pages on her github repo. There is a dark theme, and a light theme. 

Specific Style/Rule Guide: All components must follow functional component patterns. Prefer Hooks over class components. 

Specific Task: The next step is to make a mobile friendly version, that's responsive. Second step is to implement the dark mode. third is to refactor the existing code up to the best coding standards.
